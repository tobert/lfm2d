# Ported from the megakernel council, council/server.py (~/src/megakernel-qwen38-flashnext-strixhalo, MIT,
# 2026-10-03), onto lfm2d's held contexts and multi-context opinion reads (docs/integration.md invariants 16-19).
"""The council: several held contexts judge each proposed agent action, as a client of an lfm2d daemon.

demo/web/server.py mounts this module under /council/api/* and serves its page (static/council.html) at /council. It
starts on the first request there: the other demos never pay for it. Standard library only.

On the left, tabs: one per context (default three, from council_scenario.py: Memory, User, Session; at most 8, the
most one read takes). Each tab is a small chat: a system turn (the scenario's REVIEWER framing, the tab's name and
preamble), then messages the user adds, edits and deletes, and an ask box that runs System 2 in that tab (a streamed
POST /v1/chat; the reply joins the tab). Each tab's head is held on the daemon as a pinned context built from
messages (POST /v1/contexts {system, messages, pin: true}); the daemon refuses control-token text in any turn rather
than escaping it, and that refusal is shown to the page. After any change the tab is pinned again and its old context
deleted, unless another tab holds the same id: the id is the content, and a delete is not reference-counted.

On the right, decisions: an action (typed, or one of the scenario's) is ONE POST /v1/opinion with `contexts` = the
included tabs' contexts in tab order, the current spec, and the spec's verdict question, pooled by the daemon (linear
| loglinear, uniform | mass weights). This module recomputes the daemon's pool from the reads (council_pool.py, the
same operations as lfm2d/src/pool.rs) and stops the job loudly on any difference, then computes what the page shows:
both pools (the ternary plot's two stars), the pooled verdict (the top option, ties to the earlier one: the daemon
never picks), and leave-one-out.

Specs: two, consumer-owned, in static/ (uploaded at boot, content-addressed): council-describe-v3, the default, has
each context describe the action first and then reads the verdict, so every description comes from inside its own
context; council-verdict-v3 asks the verdict cold, at the first slot, like the megakernel's letters. Both name the
agent as the proposer ("nobody here requested it") and label the input "Action proposed by the agent". Field and
option names come from GET /v1/opinion/specs, never from this file; the two specs must ask the same options. The
options run from routine to loudest, so the last one is the louder ask the page alarms on. The v1 and v2 specs stay in
static/ (the benchmarks name them) and are not loaded.

The fence: every read sends the action set off on its own lines (FENCE, the fence the 2026-10-03 speaker-and-quoting
run pre-registered in benchmarks/lfm25/council/speaker-v1-prereg.json): on an unseen scenario describe-first passed the
bar only fenced (docs/lfm25-adjudicator.md, "Speaker and quoting"). The fence is the read's rendering: decisions and
the page keep the action as typed. An action holding a line that opens or closes a fence is refused (400).

Backfill: when the set of contexts changes (an edit, an ask's reply, an include toggle, a tab added or removed) or the
spec does, the last BACKFILL_K decisions are re-read under the new set, one read each, and each card whose pooled
verdict changed is marked with the flip (old -> new) and what caused it. A pool change re-pools the stored reads (no
read). Replay re-reads one decision under the same contexts and spec and compares the bits: a repeated read is
identical (invariant 17), so a mismatch is a bug, shown as one.

Restarts: a daemon restart forgets every context and uploaded spec. A read that meets a 404 for either pins every tab
again (or uploads the specs again) and retries once; the ids are the content, so they come back the same.

Ask: /v1/chat never continues from a held context and never takes an assistant turn as text (invariant 16). So an ask
starts a fresh chat from the tab's system turn and its messages (all user turns) plus the question, and when the tab
already holds a reply from an earlier ask, the ask continues that chat `from` its checkpoint, but only while the tab
still holds exactly what that chat held (later notes are appended as user turns). A tab whose reply the daemon can no
longer continue (edited since, evicted, restarted) refuses the ask with a 400 that says so: delete the reply, or add
the question as a note.

Trust: an action is the read's `state.input`, fenced. The daemon refuses control-token text in it (400) instead of escaping
it, so this module needs no denylist; the refusal goes to the page as the daemon wrote it.

One engine thread owns the daemon calls; every change runs there in order. The page gets server-sent events.
