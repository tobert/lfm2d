# Ported from the megakernel council, service/pool.py (~/src/megakernel-qwen38-flashnext-strixhalo, MIT, 2026-10-03),

"""Pooling one question's reads across held contexts, as `/council/v1/decisions` with `contexts` pools them.

Plain Python floats (IEEE f64), no numpy. Every sum over contexts or options is a loop in request order, as in
lfm2d/src/pool.rs, so the daemon's pooled answer and this module's agree on the same reads, to float rounding (the
council checks that on every read, to a tolerance, and fails loudly when they don't).

The inputs are each context's raw option logprobs (the full-vocabulary log probability of each option's answer tokens,
in the spec's option order: the wire keys them by option name) and its raw mass (`exp` of the answer's `mass`, which
the wire gives as a log). The contract has the daemon re-derive every number in f64 from those, so there is no
widening to undo.

- linear:    q = sum_c w_c p_c, renormalized. "Some context supports it."
- loglinear: q = softmax(sum_c w_c l_c), a product of experts. "The contexts agree on it": sharper, and an option any
  one context rules out stays low.
- weights: "uniform", "mass" or one weight per context; normalized to sum to 1.
- agree: every context's top option is the same (ties go to the earlier option). Per context, never from the pool.
- spread: max over options of (max_c p - min_c p).
- weights: the normalized weight each context pooled with, in request order (a 0 did not count).
- leave_one_out[c]: the pooled probabilities without context c (empty for one context; None where the remaining
  weights sum to 0, or where a log-linear pool of the rest rules every option out).

No winner: the pick is the caller's (`argmax` here, ties to the earlier option, is the council's own). A pooled
probability is not calibrated just because each context's was: nothing here fits anything.
