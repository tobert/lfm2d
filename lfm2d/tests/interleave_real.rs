//! Interleaving on the real LFM2.5-8B-A1B: a generative adjudication with
//! opinion reads, F8 reads and probes served at its pauses produces the
//! same tokens, the same logprobs and the same report as it does alone,
//! and every job served at a pause produces the numbers it produces alone.
//! On one backend the engine is deterministic, so "the same" is bit for bit
//! (serialized `f32`s compared as text), not a tolerance.
//!
//! The schedule is driven two ways: a hand-written [`YieldPoint`] that runs
//! chosen jobs at chosen pauses (prefill chunks and decode tokens, by
//! count, so the test is exact and does not depend on timing), and the
//! production worker through a `Handle`, where a read submitted during a
//! generation must come back before it.
//!
//! Ignored by default: each test loads and hashes the 6 GB GGUF (the first
//! test twice, so that the alone and the interleaved runs start from empty
//! caches). `tests/support` names the GPU (`LFM2D_TEST_GPU`, default rocm;
//! never cpu or auto) and arms the host-memory guard. Run them one at a time:
//!
//!   cargo test -p lfm2d --release --features rocm --test interleave_real \
//!     -- --ignored --test-threads=1 --nocapture
