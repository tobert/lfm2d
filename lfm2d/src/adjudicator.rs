/// Why nested at the pause and not resumable step machines: a paused job's
/// progress is already plain owned values (a `ModelState` it cloned out of
/// the caches, its logits, its sampler), so the only thing in the way of
/// running another job at its pause is the `&mut` generator borrow — and
/// `pause` takes that borrow back as an argument. The price is a rule the
/// generator must keep: hold NO borrow into its own caches or spec store
/// across a `pause`, and publish to a cache only after the last pause, from
/// a complete result, re-resolving the entry it publishes into
/// (`Adjudicator::generate` shows the pattern). Reads served at a pause never
/// pause themselves, so they may hold their borrows as before.
